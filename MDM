Opiate OD, accidental

Patient presents after accidental overdose of opiates. His history and physical exam support this. Symptoms resolved completely with a dose of Narcan prior to arrival. There was a brief episode of chest pain noted however, this was fleeting and unlikely to represent any significant underlying process. Screening EKG will be obtained but do not believe any further work-up is warranted for this and this does not represent ACS, PE, dissection or other acute life-threatening process. We will observe the patient in the ER for 4 h after Narcan administration to ensure it has metabolized completely prior to discharge to assure he does not have any return of opiate toxidrome. Patient will be discharged with take-home Narcan and information on substance abuse resources.. Patient not currently in withdrawal and as such cannot start buprenorphine at this time

– Flank pain
– Transfer nothing else to do
– Trauma baseline
– Stroke / TIA (one w/ and one w/o MUSC)
(Concern for TIA versus stroke. Symptoms seem to have resolved at this point though so I have no suspicion for stroke and do not feel that activation of code stroke needs to be done at this time. There is currently no signs of stroke mimics including but not limited to: Aortic dissection or cervical artery dissection, hypoglycemia, seizure with Todd’s paralysis, etc. Will obtain work-up including CT scan of the head, CBC and BMP, EKG, monitor on telemetry.)

– Vom/diarrhea, viral gastro
Patient is well-appearing currently and has a benign abdominal examination. Other than some mild tachycardia her vitals are unremarkable. Given the abdominal cramping pain as well as vomiting and diarrhea most likely is viral in nature. I considered but, see no indication to obtain any imaging of the abdomen pelvis as I do not have any’s concern for an acute surgical process at this point.

Clinically she appears well-hydrated other than some mild tachycardia again. Given the short duration of symptoms, and benign physical examination I do not feel that any lab workup is currently warranted. Will give her a dose of oral Zofran and reassess as well as ensure she can tolerate p.o. intake well
